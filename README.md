-  👋 Hi, I'm Bruno. I'm a passionate and curious Mechanical & Machine Learning Engineer  
-  👀 I’m interested in the application of Deep Learning in research & science and the possibilities to develop new insights into this fields
-  ⚙️ In the "Engineering AI" repo you can find my work in diverse engineering fields -from combustion and medicine to catalyst discovery-
-  📊 In the "CryptoPredictiveAI" repo you'll find my most current, ambitious and still-on-the-making project. Here I go away from the classic "batch data" engineering and start implementing a on-demand streaming data engineering problem
