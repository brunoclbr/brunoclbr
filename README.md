👋 Hey, I'm Bruno

I build production AI systems that work both off- and online — the kind that run in remote Chilean mines, Australian hospital operating rooms, and logistics warehouses in Germany where "just call the API" isn't an option.

🔧 What I'm working on right now:

📱 MacroMate - A React Native nutrition tracking app that uses local LLMs to turn "I ate a sandwich" into structured database entries. Launching January 2025. Building it to prove offline mobile AI is ready for real products.

🏥 ISSA - Hospital image segmentation software for medical imaging. Because healthcare data can't just live in the cloud.

🚀 MIRAI Engineering - My AI company delivering custom deep learning systems for any business, from automotive to bakeries. We specialize in markets too niche for big tech.

On the side:

✍️ Writing a newsletter about what ML engineering actually looks like in production vs. what clients expect
🧠 Documenting 5 years of lessons learned deploying AI in industrial environments

🛠️ Tech I'm deep in lately:
Python • Rust • React Native • TypeScript • Drizzle ORM • SQLite/Turso • Node.js • Expo • Computer Vision • Deep Learning deployment strategies

💡 Things I believe:

- The competitive advantage isn't the model —it's engineers who can deploy it where internet doesn't exist
- Most "AI engineering" content is either hype or theory. I like to think I share what actually works in production
- Mobile AI development is harder than people think, but we're finally at the inflection point
